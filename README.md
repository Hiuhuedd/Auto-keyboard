# Auto-keyboard
Auto keyboard uses machine learning to make writing suggestions as you type. And what's really cool about the feature is that it works on a per-keystroke basis. As you're typing, the brain behind Auto keyboard is thinking and predicting what you'll want to say next. It's not robot speak eitherâ€”it's conversational yet professional when it needs to be. For example, while composing an assignment, Auto keyboard will make suggestions based on context. With a quick press of the Tab key, you can write clear and concise sentences using the easy tool.
